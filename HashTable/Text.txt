One of the most promising areas in the development of modern robots are so-called soft robotics
Interest in them is due to the fact that these technologies will allow robots to acquire new
mechanical skills that will help them adapt to the environment, mainly with rapidly changing
conditions The use of soft robotics technologies contributes to a significant reduction
